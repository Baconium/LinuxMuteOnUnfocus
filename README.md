Linux Mute on Unfocus is a mod that mutes the game when unfocused on Linux (and probably windows too idk I dont have a windows pc to test on). It does this by comparing GetForegroundWindow and the PID of GD every "X" milliseconds to see if GD is the current "focused" window. "X" is configurable in the mods settings, with a default of 100ms. 

By default, the game "polls" on a seperate thread from the main game, as to not affect the games performance (even though polling on the main thread *likely* makes zero noticable or traceable difference). There is an option to use the main "game thread" for if you have a low thread count, but keep in mind no matter what you have this set to it will probably make ZERO actual difference in game, even on super slow hardware.

Thats abnout it though, I'm not even gonna put a features list in here for this mod, as its an *extremely* simple mod.
