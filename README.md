this mod will NOT be submitted to the geode mod index, as the way it was made and how it works is completely dogshit.

the mod runs a check to see if the window is focused every single frame. if it's in focus, unmute. if not, mute. this is the simplest way to implement this functionality to make it work on linux, while also being the stupidest way to implement it. DO NOT USE THIS MOD.

I might update it some day to make it *less* dogshit, but until then, I wouldn't use this. the only reason I am is to make modding the game slightly less annoying for myself.
